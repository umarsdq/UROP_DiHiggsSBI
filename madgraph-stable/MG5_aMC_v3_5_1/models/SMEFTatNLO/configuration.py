# UFO configuration

# The present model employs the five-flavour scheme
# with a massless bottom quark and neglects its Yukawa coupling.
# To account for the significant Higgs boson interaction, at tree level only
# and in the unitary gauge, the following flag can be turned to 'True'.
# In addition to the SM bottom Yukawa coupling parameter 'ymb',
# it will also activate the bottom Yukawa operator coefficient 'cbp'.
# Note that the bottom mass remains vanishing which, e.g., has a per cent effect
# on the h>bb partial width (0.005437 GeV with ymb = 4.7 GeV and MB = 0
# vs. 0.005391 GeV with ymb = 4.7 GeV = MB).
