/vols/cms/us322/nsbi_for_dihiggs/helpers/likelihood_visualizers.py:53: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`). Consider using `matplotlib.pyplot.close()`.
  fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (4,4))
